# xdmod-notebooks
This repository contains example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the XDMoD Data Analytics Framework via the [`xdmod-data` package](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-data).

## Download
This `xdmod-notebooks` repository can be downloaded from this GitHub page by clicking the "Code" button and choosing the method of download.

## Setup
Follow the instructions below to set up your system to run the notebooks in JupyterLab either through Anaconda or Docker.

### Anaconda
1. Install Anaconda following [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html).
1. Open Anaconda Navigator following [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/verify-install/).
1. Launch JupyterLab.
1. Open a Terminal.
1. If your conda environment is not activated (i.e., if the command line does not have `(base)` in front of it), activate it by running this command:
    ```
    conda activate
    ```
1. Install the packages needed to run the example notebooks using this command:
    ```
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade xdmod-data python-dotenv tabulate
    ```

### Docker
1. Install Docker following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
1. Make sure you have downloaded this repository.
1. In a terminal / command prompt, change directories to your downloaded copy of `xdmod-notebooks` and then into the `docker` directory inside there.
1. Build a Docker image called `xdmod-notebooks` from the provided Dockerfile by running this command (make sure to include the dot):
    ```
    docker build -t xdmod-notebooks .
    ```
1. Run a new Docker container named `xdmod-notebooks` on port `8888` by running this command:
    ```
    docker run -p8888:8888 --name xdmod-notebooks xdmod-notebooks
    ```
1. Copy-paste the URL listed on your Terminal into a web browser to take you to JupyterLab.
1. Subsequent runs of the Docker container should use this command instead:
    ```
    docker start -i xdmod-notebooks
    ```

## Usage
1. Once you have JupyterLab open, you can upload and run the notebooks from your copy of this repository by clicking the Upload button (![Screenshot of upload button](docs/img/jupyter-upload.jpg)). If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, the "Help" tab may provide useful information.
