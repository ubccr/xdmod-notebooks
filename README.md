# xdmod-notebooks

This repository contains example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use the
XDMoD Data Analytics Framework via the [`xdmod-data`
package](https://pypi.org/project/xdmod-data/).

This documentation is for **v1.x.y (development branch)**. For documentation of other versions:

- [v1.0.3](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-notebooks/tree/v1.0.3?tab=readme-ov-file#xdmod-notebooks)
- [v1.0.2](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-notebooks/tree/v1.0.2?tab=readme-ov-file#xdmod-notebooks)
- [v1.0.1](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-notebooks/tree/v1.0.1?tab=readme-ov-file#xdmod-notebooks)
- [v1.0.0](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-notebooks/tree/v1.0.0?tab=readme-ov-file#xdmod-notebooks)
- [v2.x.y (main development branch)](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-notebooks/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#xdmod-notebooks)

## Download

The latest version of this `xdmod-notebooks` repository can be downloaded from
the [releases page](https://github.com/ubccr/xdmod-notebooks/releases) â€” under
"Assets," click one of the "Source code" links.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to set up your system to run the notebooks in
JupyterLab either through Anaconda or Docker.

### Anaconda

1. Install Anaconda following [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html).
1. Open Anaconda Navigator following [these instructions](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/verify-install/).
1. Launch JupyterLab (NOT Jupyter Notebook).

### Docker

1. Install Docker following [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
1. Run a new Docker container named `xdmod-notebooks` on port `8888` based on
   Jupyter's latest SciPy Docker image by running this command:
    ```
    docker run -p8888:8888 --name xdmod-notebooks jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest
    ```
1. Copy-paste the URL listed on your terminal / command prompt that starts with
   `http://127.0.0.1` into a web browser to take you to JupyterLab.
1. Note: Subsequent runs of the Docker container should use this command
   instead of `docker run`:
    ```
    docker start -i xdmod-notebooks
    ```

## Usage

* Once you have JupyterLab open, you can upload and run the notebooks from your
  copy of the `examples` directory in this repository by clicking the Upload
  button (![Screenshot of upload button](docs/img/jupyter-upload.jpg)). If you
  are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, the "Help" tab may provide useful
  information.
* The notebooks can be run independently and in any order; however, you may
  find this order to be the most helpful when starting out:
    1. Intro.ipynb
    1. Raw-Data.ipynb
    1. Machine-Learning.ipynb

### R example

An example R Markdown file is available [examples/R](examples/R) directory.
